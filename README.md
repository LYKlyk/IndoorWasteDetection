# IndoorWasteDetection
To achieve automatic waste detection in indoor public places, we construct a high-quality indoor waste image dataset. This dataset is more suitable for intelligent sweeping robots, and helps deep learning models achieve better performance in practical application scenarios. This dataset provides 4000 color images. In addition, it covers four common waste categories, including paper, plastic, cap, and shell. You can download this dataset from this link:
